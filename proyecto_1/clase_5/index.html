      <p>
        Costa Rica (/ˌkɒstə ˈriːkə/, US: /ˌkoʊstə/ (About this soundlisten);
        Spanish: [ˈkosta ˈrika]; literally "Rich Coast"), officially the
        Republic of Costa Rica (Spanish: República de Costa Rica), is a country
        in <a class="concepto" href="#">Central America</a>, bordered by
        <a class="concepto" href="#">Nicaragua</a> to the north, the
        <a class="concepto" href="#"> Caribbean Sea</a> to the northeast,
        <a class="concepto" href="#">Panama</a> to the southeast, the Pacific
        Ocean to the southwest, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has
        a population of around 5 million[4][5] in a land area of 51,060 square
        kilometers (19,714 square miles). An estimated 333,980 people live in
        the capital and largest city, San José, with around 2 million people in
        the surrounding metropolitan area.[9]

        The sovereign state is a unitary presidential constitutional republic.
        It is known for its long-standing and stable democracy, and for its
        highly educated workforce, most of whom speak English.[10] The country
        spends roughly 6.9% of its budget (2016) on education, compared to a
        global average of 4.4%.[10] Its economy, once heavily dependent on
        agriculture, has diversified to include sectors such as finance,
        corporate services for foreign companies, pharmaceuticals, and
        ecotourism. Many foreign manufacturing and services companies operate in
        Costa Rica's Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment
        and tax incentives.[11]

        Costa Rica was sparsely inhabited by indigenous peoples before coming
        under Spanish rule in the 16th century. It remained a peripheral colony
        of the empire until independence as part of the First Mexican Empire,
        followed by membership in the United Provinces of Central America, from
        which it formally declared independence in 1847. Following the brief
        Costa Rican Civil War in 1948, it permanently abolished its army in
        1949, becoming one of only a few sovereign nations without a standing
        army.
